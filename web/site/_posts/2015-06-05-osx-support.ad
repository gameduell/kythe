You can build and test Kythe on OS X.

We have tested internally on 10.10.3 (Yosemite) with Xcode 6.3.1.

To build Kythe, you will first need to install http://bazel.io[Bazel]. You will
be asked to use MacPorts or Homebrew; we will use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew]. You
may also need to install some additional third-party dependencies. It's simplest
to install these before getting Bazel up and running. We depend on the following
packages:

[source,shell]
----
brew install protobuf libarchive go asciidoc leveldb ossp-uuid \
             source-highlight graphviz parallel md5sha1sum
----

Follow the instructions at http://bazel.io/docs/install.html.

Next, clone the Kythe repository:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/google/kythe.git
cd kythe
----

Do some first-time setup:

[source,shell]
----
./setup_bazel.sh
./tools/modules/update.sh
----

And build:

[source,shell]
----
bazel build //...
bazel test //...
----

Please let us know if you run into any issues by opening a
http://kythe.io/phabricator/maniphest[Phabricator task] or posting to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kythe-dev[kythe-dev mailing list].
