// cxx_extractor is meant to be a drop-in replacement for clang/gcc's frontend.
// It collects all of the resources that clang would use to compile a single
// source file (as determined by the command line arguments) and produces a
// .kindex file.
//
// We read environment variables KYTHE_CORPUS (to set the default corpus),
// KYTHE_ROOT_DIRECTORY (to set the default root directory and to configure
// Clang's header search), KYTHE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (to control where kindex
// files are deposited), and KYTHE_VNAMES (to control vname generation).
//
// If KYTHE_INDEX_PACK is set to "1", the extractor will treat
// KYTHE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as an index pack. Instead of emitting kindex files,
// it will instead follow the index pack protocol.
//
// If the first two arguments are --with_executable /foo/bar, the extractor
// will consider /foo/bar to be the executable it was called as for purposes
// of argument interpretation. These arguments are then stripped.

// If -resource-dir (a Clang argument) is *not* provided, versions of the
// compiler header files embedded into the extractor's executable will be
// mapped to /kythe_builtins and used.
